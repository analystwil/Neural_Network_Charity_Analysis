# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
- The purpose of this analysis was to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results: 

#### Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

- The variable that is considered the target in my model is below:

IS_SUCCESSFUL in which is the target or output of the model

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
		
- All of the variables except for the target would be considered features.

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

- EIN & Name columns were removed.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
        
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- I just selected random numbers in hopes to reach my 75% accuracy. I was unable to find additional resources to help me get to the correct accuracy I was attempting to achieve.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
		
- No but I did get close in which was Accuracy: 0.7250145673751831 on my last attempt.

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

- I just increased the hidden layers to increase the model performance.

### Summary: 

The deep learning module was a little difficult for me to understand and I plan on diving deeper into ML after this course. I was able to learn a little about neural networks and how they function. Cleaning up the data and the preprocessing steps allowed me to narrow down to the exact data I wanted to work with within the CSV file and from there I can create multiple models. The only reccomendation I would have is to possibly provide me resources on how to gain the correct accuracy we are looking for. Possibly have a rolling scale stating we can reach accuracy if we increase the layers by specific amounts.
